# Pipe-Inspection-Bot-Arduino-Android-Bluetooth

This app is degined especially for inspecting and analysing gas pipelines from data given by Pipe Inspection Bot through bluetooth.
The bot which we created has nine ultrasonic sensors and one odameter in it. Data from these 10 sensors is converted into a String
format as shown below.

           xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz|xyz

This data is received by our android app and used for analysing the pipe line.
You we also get data in excel format stored in internal storage which can be used for future analysis
